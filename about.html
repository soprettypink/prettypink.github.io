            <p>I used an app called <u><a href="https://toonme.com">ToonMe</a></u> to create my self portrait.</p><br>
            <p>After graduating from Maryville University with a Master’s degree in Software 
            Development, I’m currently pursuing a career in Web Design. I have a solid 
            understanding of topography, user interface design, and other concepts 
            within web design. Designing and developing websites and web apps on the 
            front end so they show amazing interfaces and provide great user experience 
            for users was a career I had dreamed of pursuing since I was an adolescent.
            I’ve gained more skills and knowledge in user interface design and user 
            experience design for websites and then taken those designs to develop them 
            on the front end. This will aid me when I go further in a serious career 
            in the Technology industry in the future. Living and working overseas for 
            several years has helped me gain new ideas and perspectives and I’d like 
            a chance to share them. 
            I understand various concepts of user interface and user experience design 
            such as knowing the importance of recognizing user goals, conducting user 
            research, understanding topography, building sitemaps, and storyboards, 
            sketching low-fidelity wireframes, designing high-fidelity wireframes, 
            and creating interactive prototypes. I’ve used Figma and Canva when 
            creating logos and building high-fidelity wireframes and have some 
            familiarity with Photoshop and Adobe XD. When it comes to Frontend Development, 
            I have tested the websites that 
            I’ve created as a project on various browsers and devices. I’m familiar 
            with SASS, LESS, and Bootstrap.  Please feel free to view my online portfolio that I’ve designed and built myself. The designs 
            that I have on my online portfolio were created using Figma and Canva.
